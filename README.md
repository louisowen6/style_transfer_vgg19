# style_transfer_vgg19

This repository provides the code implementation of Style Transfer based on VGG-19 model using PyTorch. 


Style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images — a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter) — and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image (Tensorflow.org). 


Below is the sample result from using this code implementation
